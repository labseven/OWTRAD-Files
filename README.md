# OWTRAD-Files
Database Files


# Naming Scheme:
```OWTRAD-[Name of dataset]-[edges routes].csv```

Note: Change from ```-routes``` to ```-nodes``` because the files have 'routes' in their name and it was confusing


Ex:
```OWTRAD-North African pilgrimage routes 1300-1900 CE-nodes.csv ```

Note: their lisings are named differently than their full names, it's most reliable to search by years
